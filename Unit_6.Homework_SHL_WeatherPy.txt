Observations:
1. The data from 500 plus random cities indicates a correlation between temperature increase as the location approaches the equator.  However, the highest temperatures fall just above and below latitude 0 within a range of -30? to +30? degrees latitude.  
2. The data did not provide an indication of any correlation between cloudiness levels and location near the equator. It does not appear that location near the equator is a predictor of cloudiness.
3. The data also does not show a direct relationship between a city’s location relative to the equator and its level of humidity. Therefore, it cannot be assumed that cities near the equator have high humidity.
